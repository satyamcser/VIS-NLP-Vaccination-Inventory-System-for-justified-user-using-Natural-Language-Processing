# VIS-NLP-Vaccination-Inventory-System-for-justified-user-using-Natural-Language-Processing

In the healthcare industry, especially the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, produced huge
problems with isolate patient and patient heath. Thus, created large amount of data that has
been generated every day for the patient heath, in this case is to justify the vaccination of
users from social network Twitter. Processing such large volume of the data involves high
computation overhead. Good health and well-being; to ensure healthy lives and promote
well-being for all at all ages is United Nations 3rd Sustainable Development Goal and we
want to align our study with it as well. It is crucial to create an application that is beneficial
for humanity health. When we get large datasets from pandemics like Covid-19, for large
scale datasets, we presented a solution to verify the user if they are vaccinated or not
vaccinated by using Natural Language Processing methods to build an accuracy result, we
tried to reduce the computation overhead by storing the data in distributed environment.
After processing data, training the data, used pad_sequences, Keras, NLP to build the
model. Through multiple epochs we have got an accuracy towards 90 to 91% (which is
closer to state-of-the-art methods i.e., 95%). And since our accuracy is higher, we can
further utilize it to increase for higher number of epochs. We hope scientists can further
develop it and use it in real world applications so that more precious human being lives can
be saved. By implementation of its successful results, it also aligns with one of the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals i.e., 3rd: Good Health and Well-Being.
